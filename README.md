# Ð¡hristmas_game
The academic project is a game written in C++ and built on Qt framework. 

This was a university project which I has completed in frame of course "Additional chapters of Computer science". I used Qt Creator for development on this project. The game is not fully complete and there is plenty of room for improvement. However, you may find this repository helpful in building your own games or programs. 



# Description

First of all, the initial menu of the game will appear, after which you can enter the username and set the difficulty of the game.

In the game, you need to help Santa Claus dodge the incoming crows and deliver the gifts to the children in one piece. When colliding with a bird, lives will be lost. The longer you manage to hold out, the more you will get game points. At the end of the game you get the total number of points. The rating of each player is recorded in a file.
At the video below you can see the game in action.
